# Changelog

Release notes for Zephyr. The version headings are what
`Scripts/release-notes.sh` reads, and what the Release workflow attaches to a
GitHub release — so a heading is `## <version>`, matching the tag exactly.

## 1.1

- Zephyr's website has moved to zephyrmac.app.
- A Dropbox outage no longer reads as a broken account: a token request Dropbox
  answers with a server error or a rate limit is retried, and one that keeps
  failing reports a connection problem instead of asking you to relink.

## 1.0

- First release.
